THE WEATHER OUTSIDE CLI APP

Thanks for checking out another one of my CLI apps!

Installation : npm install -g outside

To get your location's weather run: "outside today" or "outside forecast" for the 10-day forecast (location is found via your device's IP address)

To get a specific location's weather run: "outside today -location or -l <'City, State'>" or substitute "forecast" for "today" to get the 10-day forecast for a specific location.

For any issues or bugs please submit the issue @ https://github.com/justisGipson/outside/issues
